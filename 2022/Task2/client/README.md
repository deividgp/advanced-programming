The objective of this task is to use an MVC framework to create a front-end to the actor system of task 1. Communication with the actor system can be done remotely with XMLRPC or RMI for example.
The GUI should allow access to the ActorContext to list actors, create new ones and even to monitor actor message queues with progress bars. The GUI should be able to display statistics on the number of messages processed per actor. Launch for example an Actor RingApp that launches a ring to check with the interface what is happening.
You are free to select the MVC framework to use.
